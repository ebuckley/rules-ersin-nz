<h1>What is this?</h1>

This demo application uses a few different services to provide example implementation on top of the Open Fisca platform.

<h3>Open Fisca Web Service</h3>
<p>
    <a href="//api.rules.ersin.nz">api.rules.ersin.nz</a> is an instance of openfisca-aotearoa, extended with the openfisca-canterbury module. It provides a the default api access using the "openfisca serve" command.

<h2>How it works.</h2>
<p>This site is deployed on a single VPS of the smallest possible size. We use openfisca-aotearoa, python, flask, nodejs, express and plain old html to run the site.</p>
<p>This knowledge base is developed as an open source project, and you can read the code on <a href="https://github.com/ebuckley/rules-ersin-nz">github</a>. Issues, Pull Requests and contributions are welcome.</p>
